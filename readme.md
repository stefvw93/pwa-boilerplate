## Usage

### Set up your project

```bash
$ npm run setup
```

This will prompt some questions to create an initial project setup.

### Run your project

```bash
$ npm run start
```

### Build your project

```bash
$ npm run build
```

### Configure your project

You can edit `project-config.js` to change basic project configuration settings like dev server port, display name or paths.

Webpack configuration is in `_webpack/webpack.<mode>.js`.

### Generate components

```bash
$ npm run generate <name> <type>
```

Where name is your component name, and type is either `"element"` (default) or `"screen"`. (See [File structure](#file-structure))

```bash
$ npm run generate Button
# creates a Button element component
```

```bash
$ npm run generate Login screen
# creates a Login screen component
```

Code templates and output can be edited in `_scripts/code-templates` and `_scripts/generate.js`.

### File structure

> `src/index.tsx`
> Mounts your react app after styles are created.

> `src/Main`
> React root component

> `src/style`
> Style controller and other style related code

> `src/utilities`
> Utility code

> `src/common/elements`, `src/common/screens`
> Common/reusable components like (ui) elements and screens.

### Code file structure

This section just explains the current file structure. Obviously you can ignore this and do things your own way, but note you might want to edit [code templates](#generate-components).

File structure concerning a leading class called `MyComponent` is used as an example here.

#### `MyComponent`

This is a directory. The directory's leading concern is the `MyComponent` class, so it inherits the class name - note the capitalization.

#### `MyComponent/MyComponent.element.tsx`

Exposes class `MyComponent`

#### `MyComponent/MyComponent.style.ts`

Exposes styles related to `MyComponent`

#### `MyComponent/index.ts`

Use to export modules and types. Also, this is where you make last alterations: For example, wrap a react component in `withRouter`, rename an export or expose typings.

Classes should be named exports, so the class name is consistent across the project, e.g:

```typescript
// MyComponent.element.ts
export class MyComponent {
  // ...
}
```

```typescript
// index.ts
export MyComponent from "./MyComponent.element";
```

```typescript
// some other module
import { MyComponent } from "common/elements/MyComponent"`
```

Never use default exports.
